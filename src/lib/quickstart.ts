## Tool workflow (when agent_status is called)
1. Project memory + git state are already in MCP instructions from WORKSPACE_PATH.
2. For another repo, call project_context(path, query) to receive only task-relevant instructions; call mode=full only when exact full documents are needed.
3. Explore with glob (file names) and grep (content), then read_text_file.
4. Edit existing files with apply_patch; use write_file for new files. Use run_command for deterministic file moves/deletes or Git mutations.
5. For a file attached in ChatGPT use save_chatgpt_file (no Base64). For other binary transfer use read_file_base64 / write_file_base64; chunk large payloads and verify final SHA256 when possible.
6. Run builds/tests with run_command (short) or start_process + process_status/process_output/stop_process (long).
7. When appearance matters, call visual_review on the actual artifact; after a focused fix, call it again with compare_to=<prior review_id>.
8. Undo file edits with rewind (list → preview → restore). Shell/bash file changes are not tracked.

## Output format
All tools return JSON: { ok, tool, summary, data }

## Tool cheat sheet
- glob / grep / read_text_file: explore (offset+limit for partial reads)
- save_chatgpt_file: preferred path for ChatGPT conversation attachments; streams original bytes directly to disk
- read_file_base64 / write_file_base64: binary transfer; prefer small chunks in ChatGPT web
- apply_patch: single-file @@ hunks OR multi-file *** Begin Patch format
- run_command: persistent shell (cd persists); shell_status shows the current cwd and recent commands
- start_process: long-running commands; follow with process_status / process_output / stop_process
- visual_review: universal review for image/SVG/web/PDF/PPTX/DOCX with focus crops, diagnostics, comparison, and freshness tracking
- task_state: compact long-task checkpoint; tool calls automatically add failures, checks, and changed files while active
- full profile also contains experimental visual/browser/task tools; they stay hidden from ChatGPT web slim unless explicitly enabled
- git_status / git_diff: structured inspection; use run_command for commit, restore, branch, and other Git mutations
- rewind: action=list|preview|restore|status — undo file edits via automatic checkpoints
- enabled upstream MCP tools are exposed directly as <server>__<tool> (for example chrome-devtools__list_pages, linear__get_user); prefer direct tools
- full profile keeps legacy convenience, browser, task-detail, and upstream-diagnostic tools; slim intentionally exposes one preferred path per operation
