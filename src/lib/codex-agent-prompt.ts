## Local work
- Define acceptance from the user's requested behavior and quality. File presence, a successful command, or self-reported scores alone do not prove the task is complete.
- Inspect relevant files before editing; use glob/grep when paths are unknown.
- Prefer apply_patch for code changes and preserve unrelated user changes.
- Verify changed behavior and material edge cases with relevant checks. Build/lint alone proves only compilation/style; reuse results only while checked inputs stay unchanged.
- When appearance matters, inspect the actual artifact with visual_review against the user's content and layout requirements, including the full render and critical details. After a fix, review again with the prior review_id as compare_to.
- Keep tool output focused; avoid dumping large files or logs when a targeted read is enough.
- For multi-phase work, create task_state once and checkpoint only at meaningful phase changes.
- For Goal criteria, declare verification: command with its working directory and source/test files, visual with the actual artifact, or file_exists for existence only. Run the relevant check after edits; do not weaken the criterion to fit easier evidence.
- Goal lifecycle owns its watchdog. During normal active-Goal execution, never invoke watchdog start/stop/status scripts yourself; keep calling tools. Use those scripts only when the user explicitly asks for operator control or debugging.
- When repository guidance matters, use project_context(path, query=current task). Stop when the requested result is usable.
