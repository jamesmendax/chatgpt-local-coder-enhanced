/**
 * Projection contract (ported from DeepSeek Harness session-projection):
 * a projection derives state from the append-only event stream by replay.
 * Rules:
 *  - `apply` must be synchronous and pure.
 *  - `apply` MUST return the SAME state reference for events it does not
 *    consume (callers use Object.is as free change detection).
 *  - State-carrying events are whole-value: they carry the complete
 *    post-change state, never a bare delta.
 *  - Bumping `stateVersion` discards any persisted projection state derived
 *    from an older version — never migrate, replay from the log instead.
 *
 * Scope note: goal/change and task/change events carry whole snapshots, so
 * explicit state operations replay exactly. Observation-driven task fields
 * (changed_files, observed_checks, recent_events from tool/observation events)
 * are NOT folded yet — folding them is a prerequisite for switching the read
 * path to projections, not for this parity contract.
